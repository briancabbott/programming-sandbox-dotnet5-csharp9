Playground for the latest in .NET and C# (5.0, 9.0, respectively)


## Approach
I am going to assume that, as a result of Core, et al. that there are a variety of methods that
have cropped up within the .NET development space that mirror techniques similiar to Linux App Development.
i.e Command Line oriented techniques. I want to be sure to explore the totallity of what is available in this
regard 1) because I am currently on a Mac wich, I am not sure to the extent of the Visual Studio support in the 
Mac version and 2) CLI supports better the IaC and Immutable Environment principles more closely then does
an IDE.
